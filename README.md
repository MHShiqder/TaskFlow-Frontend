# TaskFlow - Task Management Application (Frontend)

## Short Description
TaskFlow is a modern, responsive task management application that allows users to create, edit, delete, and reorder tasks across three categories: **To-Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. The app features a clean and minimalistic UI, drag-and-drop functionality, and real-time updates. It is built using **Vite + React** for the frontend and integrates with a backend API for task persistence.
